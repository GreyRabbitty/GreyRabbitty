# 👋 Hello!

💻 My name is David and I'm a software developer with over 9 years of professional experience. 

🌊 For the past year, I was a web3 developer at the Ocean Protocol Foundation maintaining the Ocean python SDK and backend services like the metadata cache and data service provider. I developed features and tests for Ocean "ONDA" v4.

Previously, I
  * 🗣️ Spent three years developing a cross-platform, on-device, noise-robust speech recognition system along with desktop and native Android apps showcasing its capabilities.
  * 🛩️ Spent four years working in the aerospace and defense industry working on a variety of projects including GUI integration testing for an international network of sensors, experimental low-latency network firmware, hardware emulation software, embedded sensor software, and even dabbled in FPGA test fixture design.
